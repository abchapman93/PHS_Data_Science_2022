When food is ingested, the carbohydrates within the food are broken down into glucose molecules. Blood glucose content is significant in determining an individual's overall state of health. An elevated blood glucose level is called hyperglycemia and a deficient blood glucose level is called hypoglycemia. When an individual is hyperglycemic and cannot properly regulate their blood glucose level they are considered diabetic. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system attacking pancreatic beta cells (cells that produce insulin) and Type 2 diabetes is caused by insulin resistance. [MedlinePlus Encyclopedia:003482]\n",
