    "# Natural Language Processing\n",
    "When people talk about data science, they are often talking about **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. Broadly speaking, AI is a set of techniques for generating insights or imitating human decision-making using large datasets (\"big data\"). Most AI systems use **machine learning** which are algorithms that learn directly from data with minimal manual input. But some AI systems also utilize human knowledge in the form of complex rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of this module will focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, a form of AI which deals with text data. We'll learn what goes into an NLP system and build a model which classifies radiology reports for pneumonia. Then we'll build a small **supervised machine learning** system to predict whether a patient has diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin by learning about some new types of data in the EHR.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unstructured Data in the EHR\n",
    "When you see a doctor, they enter your information into the EHR in a few different ways. We've already seen some examples like:\n",
    "- ICD-9/10 codes\n",
    "- Numeric vital measurements\n",
    "- Flags for abnormal tests\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all **structured** data elements: the values are either numeric values or discrete elements with distinct, concrete meaning. Importantly, these values are *computable*: we can take the average of numeric vital measurements or count of ICD-10 codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, some forms of documentation are **unstructured**. Some examples are:\n",
    "- Videos\n",
    "- Radiology imaging\n",
    "- Full-text narratives\n",
    "\n",
    "Data forms like this are great for humans: they are easy to interpret and can include much more context and nuance than rigid, standardized data elements. However, they can't immediately be computed with. While a collection of pixels can be very meaningful to a radiologist, machines don't inherently have the ability to make sense of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a challenge to researchers since unstructured data accounts for a huge amount of the information stored in the EHR. While it would be great to utilize this information, we have to do a little extra work to make sense of it.\n",

    "## Design of NLP Systems\n",
    "There are two main types of NLP systems: **rule-based** and **machine learning/statistical**. We'll focus mainly rule-based in this class but will briefly go over some of the features of both.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule-based NLP** uses manually defined logic to extract information from text. For example, if you are classifying pneumonia from radiology reports, you could write out the terms that clinicians use to describe pneumonia and write code to identify mentions of pneumonia and other contextual information in the text. This works well when a task is highly specific (such as identifying pneumonia in text) so it's often used in applications such as clinical research projects which need information from text. But it doesn't generalize well when the task is very broad (like identifying any clinical concept in a text) or when the language is too complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **statistical NLP** avoids having to write out specific logic in your code. Instead, you annotate large amounts of data and train a **machine learning model** to learn statistical patterns in the data and make predictions. Most NLP research focuses on statistical approaches, particularly [transformers](https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-guide-to-transformers-step-by-step-explanation-f74876522bc0) and [large language models](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-large-language-models-will-transform-science-society-and-ai). These can learn very sophisticated patterns and often achieve higher performance than rule-based models. But they are also very computationally expensive, difficult to interpret and understand, and require lots of annotated training data which is might be more difficult than writing out rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rule-based and machine learning approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. In this class we will focus on rule-based NLP, but if you're interested in NLP beyond this course there is lots of exciting work being done in the field of statistical NLP."

    "## Measuring System Performance\n",
    "No NLP system is perfect. Natural language is complex and no system will ever be able to perfectly understand what is in clinical notes. So if you're using NLP, it's important to measure how well it performs and what impact the errors would have on any analyses on your data. **False positives** occur when your system classifies a negative case as positive. **False negatives** are when your system misses a positive case and classifies it as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, when we develop NLP systems we also perform **validation** to understand what types of errors we make. This typically involves the following steps:\n",
    "1. **Annotate** a set of notes for the concept you're interested in extracting. In this step, human reviewers define the clinical concepts they're interested in and agree upon how to identify them in texts.\n",
    "2. **Develop** your NLP system by making predictions on your annotated dataset, reviewing errors, and making improvements.\n",
    "3. **Evaluate** your system by running on a subset of notes called the *testing set* which your model/developer has never seen before. This gives you an indication of how well the system will perform on brand new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When we evaluate our system, there are a few standard quantitative metrics we typically report:\n",
    "- **Precision**/**Positive Predictive Value**: This tells you how likely it is that a document classified as positive is truly positive. It is calculated as (# of true positives) / (# all predicted positives). It is equivalent to the conditional probability of a note being positive given that it was classified as positive: $$P(Y=1|X=1)$$\n",
    "where `X` is the note classification and `Y` is the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall**/**Sensitivity**: This tells you how well your system identifies positive cases. It is calculated as (# true positives) / (# all positives). It is also the conditional probability of a note being classified as positive given that it is actually positive: $$P(X=1|Y=1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-score**: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a common summary score for system performance: $$\\frac{2 * Precision * Recall}{Precision + Recall}$$\n",
