On the current\n     chest x-rays the right hemithorax is almost completely opacified with more\n     prominent density in the lower portion of the right lung. Right pleural\n     effusion has been enlarged and is loculated.  Giving the new history of the\n     lung cancer, the above finding most probably represents almost complete\n     atelectasis of the lung due to obstructing mass with pleural effusion.  The\n     interstitial markings on the right are most probably related to the\n     lymphangitic spread of the tumor.
