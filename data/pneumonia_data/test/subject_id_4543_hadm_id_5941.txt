     INDICATION:  Right subclavian line placement after myocardial infarction.
     
     FINDINGS:
     
     A right subclavian line is seen extending to the proximal SVC.  The distal tip
     of this central line is not well seen.  The heart size and mediastinal
     contours are normal.  The lungs are clear with no parenchymal consolidation,
     failure, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion.  No osseous abnormalities are
     seen.
     
     IMPRESSION: 1)  A right subclavian line passes into the proximal SVC.  The
     distal tip of the central line is not well seen.  A repeat chest radiograph
     should be performed.
     
     2)  No evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, or CHF.
