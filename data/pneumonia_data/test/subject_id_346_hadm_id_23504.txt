     CHEST
     
     HISTORY:  Repositioning of ET tube.
     
     CHEST:  A single portable supine view is compared to previous exam earlier
     from the same date.  Since the previous exam, the endotracheal tube has been
     pulled back, now its tip is at the level of T3 and approximately 1.5 cm
     proximal to the carina.  The appearance of the lungs remains stable.  There is
     slight further resolution of the pulmonary edema.  Again, note is made of left
     basilar and paracardiac atelectasis and small left pleural effusion.
     Cardiomegaly.  The NG-tube remains in place.
