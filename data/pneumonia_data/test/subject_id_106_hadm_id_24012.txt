                                     FINAL REPORT
     INDICATION:  35-year-old, status post cardiac arrest.  Evaluate for
     infiltrate.
     
     COMPARISON:  None.
     
     AP CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  There is an ET tube, with the tip positioned in the
     lower trachea, approximately 1.5 cm above the carina.  The heart and
     mediastinal contours are within normal limits accounting for the supine
     position.  The lungs are clear.  There is mild prominence of pulmonary
     vasculature, which may reflect low lung volumes.  No pleural effusion or
     pneumothorax is seen.  The osseous structures are within normal limits, no
     fractures are identified.  There is a large amount of air within the stomach.
     
     AP PELVIS RADIOGRAPH:  Overlying structures on the trauma board obscure
     underlying detail.  The osseous structures are normal in appearance.  There is
     no evidence of fracture.  Hip joints are normal.  The sacroiliac joints and
     pubic symphysis are not widened.  The bowel gas pattern is within normal
     limits.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     1.  The ET tube tip is positioned in the lower trachea, approximately 1.5 cm
     above the carina.  Withdrawal by 2-3 cm should be considered.
     2.  There is a large amount of air within the stomach.
