                                     FINAL REPORT
     PORTABLE CHEST OF [**3139-3-20**], WITH COMPARISON [**3139-2-22**]
     
     INDICATION:  Fever.
     
     The heart size is normal but demonstrates left ventricular configuration. 
     Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing for supine positioning.
     There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is increased in
     degree of elevation since the previous radiograph.  Adjacent opacity is noted
     in the middle and lower lobe.  The presence of volume loss favors atelectasis.
     Additional patchy opacity is seen in the left retrocardiac region, and may be
     due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Followup radiographs are suggested.
