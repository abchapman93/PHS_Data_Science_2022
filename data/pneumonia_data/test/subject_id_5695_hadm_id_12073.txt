     Reason: r/o PNA

     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      88 year old man with PNA                                                        
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      r/o PNA

                                     FINAL REPORT
     HISTORY:  Pneumonia, rule out pneumonia.
     
     CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
     
     There is a large (7.5 cm) opacity in the left lower lobe posteriorly.  It
     abuts the posterior chest wall and may obscure a portion of the posterior
     diaphragm.  No gross effusion is identified.  Heart size is at the upper
     limits of normal.  No CHF, other focal opacity, or effusion is identified. The
     hilar and mediastinal silhouette is within normal limits for age.
     
     Narrowing of the acromiohumeral distance in the right shoulder is compatible
     with a chronic complete rotator cuff tear. 
     
     IMPRESSION:
     
     Focal opacity in the left lower lobe posteriorly.  In appropriate clinical
     setting, this could represent an atypical presentation of pneumonia. However,
     given the relatively discrete rounded appearance on the frontal view, the
     possibility of a focal lung mass should be considered.  As a result, short-
     term followup to resolution or, alternatively, a chest CT is recommended for
     further assessment.  Rounded atelectasis is considered much less likely given
     the absence of diffuse pleural abnormalities.
