     CHEST (PORTABLE AP)                                             Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 5148**]
     Reason: Please evaluate for infiltrates, fluid overload             
     Admitting Diagnosis: HEMOPTYSIS
     ______________________________________________________________________________
     UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION:
      82 year old man transferred from OSH with hemoptysis and report of possible PNA 
      and or CHF, currently intubated.
     REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
      Please evaluate for infiltrates, fluid overload

                                     FINAL REPORT
     EXAMINATION:  AP chest.
     
     INDICATION:  Hemoptysis.  Pneumonia.
     
     Single AP view of the chest is obtained [**2806-4-23**] at 2155 hours.  No prior films
     are available for comparison.
     
     The patient is intubated with the tip of the ET tube approx 7.5 cm above
     the carina. There is a right subclavian line with the tip in the SVC. A ng
     tube has its tip in the gastric fundus.
     
     The heart is likely top normal in size. There is a patchy opacity in the right
     mid lung field and to a lesser extent in the right lower lobe consistent with
     pneumonia.  In addition, there is increased density in the right side adjacent
     to the heart border consistent with a degree of right lower lobe collapse.
     Right pleural effusion and likely small left pleural effusion are present.
     There is mild pulmonary vascular congestion.
     
     IMPRESSION:
     Without prior comparison films, I feel that the findings likely represent
     multifocal pneumonia with likely superimposed fluid overload/early failure.
